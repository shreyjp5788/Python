    so compared to composition, aggregation also behaves like has a relationship.
    instead of creating the objects of head, body and doctype in the __init__ method of the HtmlDoc
    we have created them separately and passed to the constructor of HtmlDoc object, so the class is rewritten 
    making the difference between the composition and aggregation more obvious.
    
    so my_page has still got doctype, head, body; it's just that what owns the object has changed now 
    so even if we delete the my_page object we can still use the independent objects of doctype head and body.
